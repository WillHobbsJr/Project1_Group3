The Side Effects of Metformin
Metformin has become the first-line agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 

Used in patients 10 years and over

Metformin has been used for hundreds of years, first in herb form then later approved for diabetes treatment
Is Metformin a Wonder Drug?
Number of metformin prescriptions in the U.S. from 2004 to 2020(in millions)
The Negative Side Effects of Metformin
Mild: 
Nausea, stomach pain and upset, and diarrhea
Heartburn and gas 
Dizziness
Muscle aches
Fatigue
More serious:
Severe allergic reactions
Lactic Acidosis
Lowers B12 
Drug interactions
Difficulty in breathing
Irregular heartbeat


socioeconomic Effects
Contributing Factors:

	1. Income level
	2. Education level
	3. Occupation
	4. Family and social support
	5. Wealth
	6. Access to good nutrition
Low socioeconomic factors can lead to adverse health effects
Gender and metformin-associated 
adverse drug reactions
Gender differences in the number and severity of side effects were observed in the initial dosing of Metformin

Women had more side effects than men

Women were more likely to discontinue use of Metformin because of adverse side effects

Women may benefit from lower doses of the drug

Patients who quickly changed doses reported more side effects
Metformin, Phenformin, and Mounjaro
Metformin improves the body’s response to insulin and effectively treats type 2 diabetes. Phenformin is a common drug used in some forms of metformin that treat type two diabetes.
Phenformin is known as a general Biguanides, meaning it is used to mostly lower the blood sugar levels of type two diabetics to keep their levels at a respected level.
Mounjaro is a common medication that includes phenformin in its creation. Prescribed for Diabetes type 2 patients. 
Phenformin has now been withdrawn in most countries because of its association with severe and occasionally fatal lactic acidosis. It causes fatal conditions in 50% of its users in about 45 noted countries. Its most common fatal side effect includes cardiovascular problems, meaning 50% of its users report trouble breathing after extended use.
In some cases, the use of Phenformin in prescription drugs can lead to cases of Thyroid cancer, Acute kidney injury, Pancreatitis, Retinopathy, and Severe GI disease.
∙         There are similar drugs that include the drugs phenformin and have a similar effect on the body as Metformin.  These drugs include Ethinyl estradiol (levonorgestrel), Mounjaro, and Ethinyl estradiol (Desogestrel).
∙         All these drugs are prescribed to both regulate insulin levels and sometimes used in Emergency Contraception cases. But all have side effects of raising a patient’s blood pressure, dizziness, and lactic acidosis, which can all  be dangerous in some extreme cases, particularly older patients. 
Metformin and Lactic Acid
Metformin, an antihyperglycemic, is widely used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). A rare but important complication associated with this drug is the development of lactic acidosis: 
Lactic Acidosis is a disease in which lactic acid accumulates in the blood and causes acidosis in the patient.
The criteria for diagnosis are a lactate level of >2 mmol/L in the blood and a blood pH of <7.2.

The study aims to assess the risk of acidosis in diabetic advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on and off metformin.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means your kidneys are damaged and can’t filter blood the way they should
Laboratory-confirmed Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis

This study showed an increase in Lactic Acid over days of use of metformin given orally and intravenously.
And the adverse effects on vital signs
 Impaired kidney function: Metformin is primarily excreted by the kidneys, so individuals with kidney impairment are at higher risk of lactic acidosis.
  Liver dysfunction: Liver dysfunction can interfere with lactate metabolism, increasing the likelihood of lactic acidosis.
  Congestive heart failure can reduce tissue perfusion and oxygenation, contributing to lactic acidosis.
  Symptoms: Lactic acidosis can present with non-specific symptoms, making diagnosis challenging. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, rapid breathing, and an elevated heart rate. You must seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms while taking metformin.

This study showed that levels of lactic acid reduced as the dosage of metformin was reduced
A buildup of lactic acid in the bloodstream, especially in people with kidney disease, can cause serious side effects

Metformin prescriptions must be limited in these patients

Metformin has been shown to lower b12 levels in patients
A clinical trial consisting of 162 patients, 72 men, and 90 women, with an average age of 64, and use of 1536 mg metformin daily over a 5-year period significantly lowered vitamin B12. (Table 1).  Researchers have concluded comparable results across different age groups and ethnicities. However, the exact mechanisms causing vitamin B12 deficiency are not established.

Low levels of B12 damage the protective tissue around nerves, and they fail to function correctly.
Several observational studies showed that long-term use of metformin leads to significantly lower vitamin B12 levels.
There was a 17.8% to 26.8% reduction of B12 in cross-sectional studies and 6.3% to 18.7% in clinical studies.
Positive side effects of metformin
Metformin has also been shown to have positive effects in some patients. 
For patients that can tolerate the negative side effects – metformin has been shown to have: 
Cardiovascular benefits
Weight loss in diabetics
Delay or prevent diabetes in prediabetics
Control blood sugar during pregnancy
Aids in menstrual regulation in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
Lesson weight gain in patients taking psychiatric drugs

Effects Under Study 
Lower cancer risks
Lesson cognitive decline
Lower stroke rate
Slow aging and increase life expectancy

Cardiovascular disease lowered by Metformin
In 2019, there were 18.56 million world deaths from cardiovascular diseases and 1.55 million deaths from Diabetes.
In the age range of 15–49-year-olds, there were 1.24 million world deaths from cardiovascular disease and 120,735 from diabetes.
In the age range of 50-69-year-olds, there were 5.11 million world deaths from cardiovascular disease and 581,447 from diabetes
Modern studies of adults over the age of 70 show death rates even higher for both diseases
Data is from 1950 to 2019
The data showed that cardiovascular disease was the number one cause of deaths every year studied
The data also showed that diabetes also caused a significant number of deaths
High insulin rates are a risk factor for both diseases
Metformin has been shown to reduce blood insulin levels significantly

In more detailed studies, the data indicated that black females had the highest percentage of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease and diabetes
Socioeconomic studies have shown that this group has the highest mortality 
Because women, especially black women, were not taken seriously by medical professionals when they were having heart attacks
They were also less likely to be treated for diabetes 
They would not have access to drugs like Metformin
